## LaTeX Homework Template @ Colgate

This is the LaTeX template I have used for all my mathematics assignments. 
Deliberately kept simple. The header looks like:

```
COSC 000                  Jinseob Sohn
Fall 20XX                Assignment XX
______________________________________
```
Declared environment ```question``` where one could input answers to questions. Each time you declare the ```question``` environment, the question number will increment by 1. So,
```
1.  % \begin{question} ... \end{question}
2.  % \begin{question} ... \end{question} 
...and so forth.
```
